# SUGAR-SIGHT---Proactive-Diabetes-Detection

Welcome to SUGAR-SIGHT, a project dedicated to the early detection and proactive management of diabetes. Our mission is to leverage the power of data science to develop a model that predicts diabetes onset, enabling healthcare professionals to intervene early and personalize treatment plans.

## Executive Summary
We face a global increase in diabetes cases, and healthcare systems are strained to efficiently identify and manage individuals at risk. Manual analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is often too slow. Our solution is a machine-learning model that predicts diabetes onset with high accuracy, optimizing patient care and resource allocation.
The objective is to leverage the Diabetes Prediction dataset to develop a robust machine-learning model that can predict the likelihood of diabetes onset in patients with high accuracy. The goal is to create a predictive model that healthcare professionals can use for early diagnosis and formulate personalized treatment plans. 


## Project Overview
Data Source: A dataset from Kaggle representing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from 2015.
Goal: Utilize this dataset to build a predictive model to assist in the early diagnosis of diabetes.
Approach: Conduct thorough exploratory data analysis, apply machine learning methods, and generate actionable insights.
Data Alterations
Duplicate Removal: Ensuring dataset integrity by removing duplicates.
Clarifying Ambiguities: Excluding ambiguous categories for more accurate analysis.
Outlier Management: Refining data by excluding outliers to prevent analysis distortion.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We've delved deep into the data to understand the distribution and prevalence of diabetes across different demographics and correlated health conditions.

## Modeling Methods
Outcome Variable: Predicting the presence of diabetes.
Features: Age, BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose level, and others.
Model Type: Logistic Regression, ideal for binary outcomes like diabetes prediction.
## Findings and Recommendations
Model Performance: Our model shows promising accuracy in predicting non-diabetic cases but requires refinement in detecting actual diabetic cases.
Business Application: Accurate predictions are essential for planning and personalizing patient care.
Action Points: Develop strategies to follow up with at-risk patients and integrate feedback into the model to improve accuracy.
## Next Steps
Refine Predictive Model: Improve accuracy with advanced algorithms.
Data Enrichment: Integrate broader health determinants into our analysis.
Patient Engagement: Encourage proactive health management based on model predictions.
Decision Support: Incorporate the model into clinical systems for evidence-based recommendations.
Appendix
Technical details on the significance of glucose and HbA1c levels in diabetes prediction are provided.
